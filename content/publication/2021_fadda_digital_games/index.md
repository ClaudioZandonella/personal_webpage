abstract: "**Background.** Motivation is an important factor in the learning process and supporting students' motivation in mathematics is a significant challenge for educators. Educational technologies, such as digital games, offer potential for engagement in mathematics learning activities. **Objectives.** To contrast the general decrement in student motivation in mathematics, a multilevel meta-analysis was carried out to synthesize the results of studies concerning the impact of digital games on K-12 student motivation in mathematics. **Methods.** Standardized measure of effect size (dppc2) for pre- post-control group designs was used, and different sources of dependency among the effects were taken into account. Moreover, through meta-regressions, we examined whether specific characteristics of the participants, interventions and outcomes were associated with effect size differences throughout the studies. **Results and Conclusions.** A total of 20 primary studies (43 effect sizes) meeting eligibility criteria was included. Results showed a significant overall effect (dppc2 = 0.27; 95%CI = [0.14; 0.41]) and a great heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses showed differences in effect size associated to the duration of intervention and motivational construct in terms of expectancy and value. **Implications.** Overall, the findings indicate that digital games are effective tools compared to conventional teaching practices. The results are promising and could be useful for the design of digital educational interventions aimed at promoting motivation in mathematics."
