abstract: "It is widely appreciated that many studies in psychological science suffer from low statistical power. One of the
consequences of analyzing underpowered studies with thresholds of statistical significance is a high risk of finding
exaggerated effect size estimates, in the right or the wrong direction. These inferential risks can be directly quantified in terms of Type M (magnitude) error and Type S (sign) error, which directly communicate the consequences
of design choices on effect size estimation. Given a study design, Type M error is the factor by which a statistically
significant effect is on average exaggerated. Type S error is the probability to find a statistically significant result
in the opposite direction to the plausible one. Ideally, these errors should be considered during a prospective design
analysis in the design phase of a study to determine the appropriate sample size. However, they can also be considered when evaluating studies’ results in a retrospective design analysis. In the present contribution, we aim to
facilitate the considerations of these errors in the research practice in psychology. For this reason, we illustrate how
to consider Type M and Type S errors in a design analysis using one of the most common effect size measures in
psychology: Pearson correlation coefficient. We provide various examples and make the R functions freely available
to enable researchers to perform design analysis for their research projects."
