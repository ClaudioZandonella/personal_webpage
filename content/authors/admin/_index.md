I am a PhD student in Psychological Sciences. My major research interest concerns the formalization of psychological theories and research hypotheses as statistical models. In particular, I currently work on the formalization of experts judgements and relevant knowledge in the field using informative prior within a Bayesian analysis.

Moreover, I am really enthusiastic about R environment and other programming languages as STAN, LaTeX and everything that is related to making open and reproducible science.
