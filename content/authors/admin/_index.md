During my PhD, I fell in love with data science. Understanding the complex phenomena that affect our lives by exploring data, formulating hypotheses, building models, and validating them. I find the whole process extremely challenging and motivating. In addition, I am excited about the integration of new technologies into our daily lives and how a data-driven approach can help us make better decisions in any field. I want to be part of that change that is shaping our future society.

<!--- I am a PhD student in Psychological Sciences. My research interests concern the formalization of theories and research hypotheses as statistical models within a Bayesian framework. I am also involved in the Open Science movement by promoting the importance of Design Analysis and developing workflows to enhance research reproducibility and transparency.-->

<!--- I am enthusiastic about the opportunities and solutions offered by new technologies, programming software, and everything that is related to making open and reproducible science. In particular, I am an active R programmer and developer of R packages.-->
