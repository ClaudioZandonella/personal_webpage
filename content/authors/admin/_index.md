I am a PhD student in Psychological Sciences. My research interests concern the formalization of theories and research hypotheses as statistical models within a Bayesian framework. I am also involved in the Open Science movement by promoting the importance of Design Analysis and developing workflows to enhance research reproducibility and transparency.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunities and solutions offered by new technologies, programming software, and everything that is related to making open and reproducible science. In particular, I am an active R programmer and developer of R packages.
